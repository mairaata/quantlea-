      <description>Exploring the role of AI agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) in redefining the future of intelligent systems.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a world where AI does more than just answer your questions—it solves your problems, adapts to your needs, and collaborates seamlessly across domains. <strong>AI agents—especially those powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)—are paving the way for such a future.</strong> Unlike static models, these dynamic entities combine understanding, reasoning, and action, enabling them to autonomously interact with their environment and achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>This blog series explores the <strong>Agentic Framework</strong>, starting with the fundamental concepts and the evolution of AI agents, illustrating their role as a transformative force in artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="why-standalone-llms-arent-enough">Why Standalone LLMs Aren&rsquo;t Enough</h2>
<p>Standalone LLMs, such as <strong>OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-3 and GPT-4</strong>, excel at processing and generating text-based knowledge. They can answer general queries accurately, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;How old is the universe?&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>However, when posed with more context-specific or personalized questions, they falter:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;How old is my dog, June?&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Without access to external information, the model can&rsquo;t determine whether &ldquo;June&rdquo; is a dog, a person, or even a month. This limitation arises because standalone LLMs operate without external data sources, contextual tools, or real-time feedback. These constraints often lead to generic answers or &ldquo;hallucinations,&rdquo; where the model fabricates information.</p>
<h2 id="how-ai-agents-bridge-the-gap">How AI Agents Bridge the Gap</h2>
<p>This is where <strong>AI agents excel.</strong> By acting as intelligent intermediaries, they connect LLMs with external resources, enhancing their capabilities to deliver context-specific and accurate responses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration with Tools:</strong> AI agents can query APIs, search databases, and interact with external software for up-to-date, actionable information.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous Reasoning and Action:</strong> They analyze data, make informed decisions, and act on behalf of users, enabling them to solve real-world problems that LLMs alone cannot address.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>An AI agent tasked with determining your dog&rsquo;s age could query a pet health app, incorporate your dog&rsquo;s birthdate, and provide a precise answer—bypassing the limitations of static LLM outputs.</p>
<p>This ability to integrate, reason, and act autonomously makes AI agents far more powerful and versatile than LLMs operating in isolation.</p>

<h2 id="historical-context-and-evolution-of-agents">Historical Context and Evolution of Agents</h2>
<p>Let’s step back to understand what agents are and how they evolved. The concept of agents traces back to early artificial intelligence, where &ldquo;expert systems&rdquo; mimicked decision-making. Over time, advancements in natural language processing and deep learning paved the way for modern AI agents, which are autonomous entities designed to sense their environment, reason about it, and act to achieve specific goals without human intervention.</p>
<h3 id="symbolic-agents">Symbolic Agents</h3>
<p>In the early days of AI, agents were primarily built using <strong>symbolic AI</strong>, which relied on logical rules and symbolic representations to encapsulate knowledge and facilitate reasoning. These agents aimed to emulate human thought processes by using explicit and interpretable reasoning. They primarily focused on solving problems through transduction and representation/reasoning. They have limitations with uncertainty and large-scale real-world problems. The agent operates on <strong>input symbols</strong> using a <strong>symbolic reasoning engine</strong> based on a <strong>knowledge base</strong> of symbolic rules to produce <strong>output symbols</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="rl-agents">RL Agents</h3>
<p>With the rise of <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, AI agents started to learn through interaction with their environment. These agents focused on learning through trial and error, receiving feedback (rewards or penalties) based on their actions. RL agents could perform well on specific tasks, such as playing games, however they often need to train from scratch in unseen cases. They were often limited by the need for extensive training and their inability to generalize to new scenarios. The agent interacts with the <strong>environment</strong>, receives <strong>rewards</strong>, and adjusts its policy based on the rewards.</p>

<h3 id="knowledge-agents">Knowledge Agents</h3>
<p>Knowledge agents aimed to utilize their <strong>stored knowledge</strong> for decision-making. They have the capability of maintaining an internal state of knowledge, reasoning over that knowledge, updating their knowledge after observations, and taking actions. These agents can represent the world with some formal representation and act intelligently. They take input from the environment and pass it to an inference engine which communicates with the knowledge base (KB) to decide as per the stored knowledge. The learning element of the agent regularly updates the KB by learning new knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="ai-agents">AI Agents</h3>
<p>With the development of AI, the term &ldquo;agent&rdquo; came to describe entities that exhibited intelligent behavior and possessed characteristics such as <strong>autonomy</strong>, <strong>reactivity</strong>, <strong>pro-activeness</strong>, and <strong>social ability</strong>. They are <strong>artificial entities</strong> that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions. These AI agents are autonomous and have the capacity to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, learn from their memory, and take action. These AI agents can be categorized as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple Reflex agents</strong> act based on <strong>predefined rules</strong> that map directly from a given input to an action, without considering past experiences or future consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Model-based Reflex agents</strong> use a <strong>model of the environment</strong> to determine actions, allowing them to handle situations where a direct input-output mapping isn&rsquo;t sufficient, but they still do not learn or adapt.</li>
<li><strong>Goal-based agents</strong> make decisions based on <strong>explicit goals</strong>, choosing actions that will help them achieve these objectives, often needing to plan a series of actions to achieve a complex goal.</li>
<li><strong>Utility-based agents</strong> choose actions that will <strong>maximize their utility</strong>, which is a measure of how well the agent is doing, by taking into consideration both the goal and a measure of success.</li>
<li><strong>Learning agents</strong> can <strong>learn from their experiences</strong> and adapt their behavior over time, improving their performance through machine learning techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="llm-agents">LLM Agents</h3>
<p>More recently, <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong> have become the foundation for building AI agents. LLMs provide agents with advanced capabilities in command interpretation, knowledge assimilation, and human-like reasoning. <strong>LLM-based agents</strong> use LLMs as their primary decision-making component and are enhanced with features like memory. These agents can understand natural language, plan tasks, and use tools effectively, making them adaptable to various tasks. <strong>LLM agents</strong> can interact with each other and have shown the ability to generate new behaviors. <strong>LLM-based agents</strong> can be single or multi-agent systems. They can engage in collaboration and competition, and form social structures.</p>
